Research title: **Learning a Foundation Model of Human Social Reasoning from Heterogeneous Experts**.

This repository contains the public project website. Data, code, and model releases are forthcoming.

## Local preview

Run `python3 -m http.server 8000` in this directory and open http://localhost:8000/.
No build step is required.

## Deployment

GitHub Pages publishes the root of the `main` branch. Push website changes to that branch and wait for the Pages deployment to complete.

## Release links

Set the three entries of `RELEASE_URLS` at the top of `app.js` when ready:

- `data`: the Hugging Face dataset URL
- `code`: the GitHub code repository URL
- `model`: the Hugging Face model URL

Empty values display Coming soon. Valid URLs activate both the homepage and release section entries.

## Content

The benchmark presents accuracy (%) for eight main evaluation datasets. GSS2022 is a separate held-out transfer evaluation. Animated particles are a conceptual visualization, not live inference or individual respondent records.

The project is presented as a research preview. Release URLs and final publication metadata can be added when available.
